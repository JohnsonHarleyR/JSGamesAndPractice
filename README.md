# JSGamesAndPractice
The new repository for the games I'm making to practice JavaScript.
<br>
This can be found online <a href="http://jspractice-env.eba-6mepv4gx.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/">here</a>.
<hr>
<br>
The important files can be found by navigating to src/main/.<br>
Then look under resources/static/js to find the JavaScript files, or look under webapp/WEB-INF/views to find the HTML/JSP pages.
<br><br>
<b>More will probably come in the future!</b>


<h1>Practice Pages</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Tic Tac Toe</li>
  <li>Minesweeper</li>
  <li>Roadside Bingo <i>(not finished)</i></li>
</ul>
